    "# 1.Introduction\n",
    "At the end of 2019, the COVID swept the world and had a significant impact on all aspects of people's daily lives. To control the spread of the virus, various measures were taken to limit social interactions and ensure sufficient social distance. Daily travelling patterns have changed dramatically as a result. To further understand how and why travel patterns changed during such a global crisis, we divided people into different groups according to different classification criteria, analyzed and compared the changes in travelling of different groups before and after the Covid. Based on these analysis, we aim to derive the overview of the impacts of Covid on people's travelling.\n"

Then focused on these 8 age groups, several graphs are drawn to show the changes on travels numbers, travel distance and travel time respectively according to the year before and after Covid (2019 and 2020). Moreover, the trips relative to to and from work are especially analysed and compared with the overall trips."

    "First, we compared the frequency of travel before and after Covid. It shows a significant decrease in frequency, regardless of income group. However, the extent of the reduction in the number of trips (y axis) was different for different groups, with the first income tier group ('1e'in x axis) experiencing the greatest reduction in the number of trips.\n",

For travelling by private cars('Personenauto'), the data of both travelling as passengers and drivers are listed together.\n",

However, when it comes to To-and-From work travels, people aged between 25-35 years had the largest drop on all these three characters: travel numbers, travel distance and travel time.\n",
